                though such customer does not have own mailing-lists/contact-lists. It is customer’s responsibility to
                keep acquiring contacts legitimately with a DOUBLE-OPTIN policy (all the info and related URLS are
                supplied within the portal) following all the guidelines of CAN-SPAM ACT. Once the customer creates a
                new contact-list, such customer will be supplied with an URL respective to that list which the customer
                can use in his campaigns requesting his network of contacts to get subscribed to such contact-list. Its
                customer’s responsibility to deploy/publicize these URLs requesting subscription from his network of
                contacts, externally to the portal i.e. the customer should contact his network of contacts with opt-in
                requests with the help of supplied URLs for a related contact-lists using his own email accounts, email
                clients and eMail servers externally to the portal. Of course, the customer can use portal’s inbuilt
                mechanism to import contacts into his contact-lists by sending opt-in request emails using the portal’s
                email engines but we are not responsible for its effectiveness as these email engines which we allotted
                to our customers exclusively to send opt-in requests are not chargeable being offered as bonus/free
                service to all our customers along their paid account. And these eMail servers are highly vulnerable for
                black-listing, we are not responsible for the effectiveness of subscription of the contacts into your
                contact lists if you use these eMail servers to deploy your optin requests.
