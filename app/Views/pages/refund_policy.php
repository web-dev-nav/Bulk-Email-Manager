            <u>IMPORTANT</u>:<br>(a) We only charge our customer(s) for the services of mass-mailing mechanism including
            its robust eMail engines. The recruiting database that we provide our customer(s) with is a bonus service
            and we are not accountable for its effectiveness. Though it is a bonus service, we always make it sure that
            this database is an active, powerful and periodically maintained one to meet all the needs of our customer
            base. This database do largely benefit most of our customers recruiting needs eliminating the necessity for
            them to upload and maintain their own mailing lists.
            <br><br>(b) Every new customer has our shared-database (which is non-chargeable, shared and free) to start
            with and continue to deploy their recruiting stuff to it even though such customer does not have own
            mailing-lists/contact-lists. It is customer’s responsibility to keep acquiring contacts legitimately with a
            DOUBLE-OPTIN policy (all the info and related URLS are supplied within the portal) following all the
            guidelines of CAN-SPAM ACT. Once the customer creates a new contact-list, such customer will be supplied
            with an URL respective to that list which the customer can use in his campaigns requesting his network of
            contacts to get subscribed to such contact-list. Its customer’s responsibility to deploy/publicize these
            URLs requesting subscription from his network of contacts, externally to the portal i.e. the customer should
            contact his network of contacts with opt-in requests with the help of supplied URLs for a related
            contact-lists using his own email accounts, email clients and eMail servers externally to the portal. Of
            course, the customer can use portal’s inbuilt mechanism to import contacts into his contact-lists by sending
            opt-in request emails using the portal’s email engines but we are not responsible for its effectiveness as
            these email engines which we allotted to our customers exclusively to send opt-in requests are not
            chargeable being offered as bonus/free service to all our customers along their paid account. And these
            eMail servers are highly vulnerable for black-listing, we are not responsible for the effectiveness of
            subscription of the contacts into your contact lists if you use these eMail servers to deploy your optin
            requests.
            <br><br>(c) The systems and network of the portal is a shared one amongst all our customers. Generally, in
            peak load/hours (prime time) of the recruiting market, the load may be higher on our systems that some of
            the distributed messages may be kept in the queue for a while before the start of the transmission, and also
            the speed may decrease in these heavy-load situations. Mostly, this waiting period in queue is not much
            longer than 30min but we are not at all accountable/answerable for this waiting-period before the actual
            transmission, and also for an occasional low-speed in transmission.
            <br><br>(d) The ability and the rate/amount of successful delivery of an high volumetric traffic of a
            mass-mailing technology depends not only on its configuration &amp; functionality but also contemporary
            internet messaging and SPAM controlling policies. The eMailing technologies, SPAM controlling bots, emailing
            traffic (high volume traffic) controlling polices etc. always undergo for continuous changes/updates, ever.
            We always do our best trying to adjust/reconfigure our systems legitimately in sync to these ever changing
            policies/techniques in order to serve our clients without any failure. Temporarily or permanently, if we are
            failed fully or partially to run/maintain our systems towards serving our clientele and their business due
            to these policy changes/updates related to internet messaging/emailing
            architecture/technologies/protocols/acts etc., we are not liable whatsoever to refund the already paid
            amount of any subscription/account, of any type.
            <br><br>(e) Since we do not have any control or influence on Global/Domesic wise political, social,
            healthcare issues that may affect the market(s), we do not refund at all due to these issues/conditions such
            as downtime/recession of the market(s).
